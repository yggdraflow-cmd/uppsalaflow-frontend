/**
 * The word-globe panel — Figma nodes 384:2560 (phone), 384:3232 (tablet),
 * 384:2415 (desktop).
 *
 * Figma frames this panel with a hairline on the sides that face the rest of the
 * layout, and only those: top and bottom on the phone where it is a full-width
 * band cut into the column, bottom only on the tablet where it closes the frame,
 * and the left edge on the desktop where it divides the globe from the copy. All
 * three are the same rule seen from a different side, so the borders switch per
 * breakpoint rather than the panel gaining a wrapper.
 *
 * The crosshairs follow that: the tablet drops the top pair because the panel's
 * top edge is not drawn there, so a mark on it would float on nothing.
 *
 * The desktop panel is a *share* of the canvas — Figma's 500 of 1040, 48.0769%
 * — not the 500 itself. The canvas grows to 1920 above the frame (see
 * `section-hero.tsx`) and a constant 500 spent every one of those pixels on
 * the gap between the copy and the globe: Figma holds 213px between the CTAs and
 * this panel's border, a fixed panel opens 858 at a 1600 canvas. Nothing else in
 * the row can take that width — the type is Figma's and the cards are
 * intrinsically sized — so the panel is what has to keep its proportion.
 *
 * Vertically the panel is a stretched flex item rather than Figma's 574: the row
 * grows with the window up to the 1040 cap, and this border is what continues
 * down into the trusted band's seam, so it has to reach it.
 *
 * The globe box is 416x400 on the tablet and 700x680 on the desktop, centred on
 * both axes. Figma draws 416 inside its 500 panel, which reads as a small sphere
 * adrift once the canvas opens up — the panel is a share and runs to 923 at a
 * 1920 canvas while the sphere sat at 400. The sphere is `min(width, height)`, so
 * 680 is what shows, with the box's 20px of horizontal slack keeping the glyphs
 * off the divider.
 *
 * That size is drawn for the open canvas, not for Figma's 1280 frame: the box
 * needs a panel at least 700 wide, which is a canvas of about 1456, and a row at
 * least 680 tall, which is a window of about 940. Under either the sphere paints
 * past the panel, since the box clips the canvas but the panel does not clip the
 * box.
 *
 * The testimonial cards are measured from the panel's axes rather than from its
 * edges, because they belong to the globe and not to the border. Figma's 31/322
 * and 285/89 inside a 500x574 panel are 219 left and 35 below centre, and 35
 * right and 198 above it: the card's outer edge a hair beyond the silhouette,
 * its inner edge well over it, and the cross-axis offset 0.175 of the radius.
 *
 * Those are ratios of the *silhouette*, and the silhouette is not the box. The
 * component leaves a margin for the glyphs it throws widest, so the cloud runs
 * about 0.87 of `min(width, height)` — 296 of the 340 the 700x680 box implies,
 * measured off the render. Taken from 340 the cards clear the arc by 30px, and
 * David is the one it shows on: his box hangs upward from its top edge, so
 * nothing carries him back over the cloud the way Emily's 140px of width carries
 * her. So the offsets are spent from 296: 315 and 52 for Emily, 294 and 52 for
 * David, which puts about 120px of each card over the glyphs.
 *
 * Below the 402 frame the canvas is the one thing that goes fluid, and the globe
 * is the one thing wide enough to notice, so 17/370 and 336/370 are carried as
 * percentages of the panel.
