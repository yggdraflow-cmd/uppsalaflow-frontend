 * from the logo strip above it, so `absolute` is load-bearing rather than a
 * shortcut. At `desktop-sm:` they become the two halves of a flex row and drop
 * back into flow, which is also where the offsets have to be cleared.
 *
 * What never changes is that they stay *positioned*: both carry crosshairs that
 * hang outside their own box, and a breakpoint that let either strip go `static`
 * would re-anchor those marks to the canvas.
 *
 * `display` is left to each strip. The stats strip is cut on the phone, and an
 * unprefixed `flex` here would sit in the same cascade slot as that `hidden`.

/**
 * The trusted-by band — Figma nodes 384:2560 (phone), 384:3232 (tablet),
 * 384:2415 (desktop).
 *
 * One row of four partner marks and one of three figures, re-composed rather
 * than reflowed at each frame: side by side on the desktop (540 + 499 = 1039,
 * the canvas less Figma's 1px), stacked 530px apart on the tablet with the globe
 * panel filling the space between them, and on the phone the figures are cut
 * entirely and only the logos remain.
 *
 * On the desktop the stats strip is the measured half and the logo strip absorbs
 * whatever is left — the reverse of how Figma lists them. The seam between the
 * two is not a seam: it is the globe panel's left border continuing down the
 * page, so the stats strip has to be whatever the panel is, and it is written
 * the same way — Figma's share of the canvas, 48.0769%, rather than the 499 that
 * share happens to equal at 1040. The two numbers are one measurement in two
 * files; move one and the seam leaves the border.
 *
 * Figma calls both strips 80px tall and also gives their cells 80px, which
 * cannot both be true once the two hairlines are counted. The cells are the
 * measurement that matters — they set each logo's optical centre — so the strips
 * are left to size themselves to 82 and everything around them is measured from
 * the cell edge instead.
 *
 * The desktop band is in flow, directly under the copy-and-globe row, because
 * its top edge is shared: Figma's y574 is also the bottom of the globe panel,
 * and the divider between the two strips continues the panel's left border down
 * the page on the same x540. Those are one continuous drawing, not two blocks
 * that happen to be adjacent, so they are laid out as one — the row takes the
 * canvas's spare height and the band rides on its bottom edge.
 *
 * Neither a fixed y574 nor a bottom offset survives that. Pinned to the top the
 * band stayed at 574 while the row grew and the panel border ran on past it;
 * pinned to the bottom it slid the other way and left the rule hanging in
 * mid-air. In flow the two cannot come apart.
 *
 * The 100px Figma leaves under the band is `pb` on the canvas rather than
 * anything here, so the row's `flex-1` resolves to exactly 574 at the frame.
 *
 * The "Trusted by people from" label is the one thing still absolute, and it is
 * measured from the canvas foot for the same reason — 197 is the 100 of padding
 * plus the band's 82 plus Figma's 15px of clearance above the rule.
