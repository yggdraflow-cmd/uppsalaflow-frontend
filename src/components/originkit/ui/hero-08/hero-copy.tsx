/**
 * The headline column. Two things re-pitch across the frames rather than scale:
 * the type steps 35/-1.4 to 48/-1.92 in one move at the tablet, and the whole
 * column swings from centred to left-aligned only at the desktop, where the
 * globe finally sits beside it instead of under it.
 *
 * The phone and tablet pin this block absolutely at y45 inside the canvas
 * because the globe panel below it is pinned too, and the gap between them is a
 * measured 318px / 419px rather than the sum of two auto-heights. From the
 * desktop up the column is a flex item beside the panel and is centred in the
 * row rather than carrying Figma's 140px top margin: the row grows with the
 * window now, and a top margin would have left the copy pinned to the ceiling
 * while the globe — centred in the panel — drifted down away from it. At the 574
 * row Figma's own 140 top against 175 bottom is centred to within 17px, so this
 * reproduces the frame and survives the growth.
