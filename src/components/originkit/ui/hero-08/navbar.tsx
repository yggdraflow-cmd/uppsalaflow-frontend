/**
 * Figma frames: mobile 384:2560 · tablet 384:3232 · desktop 384:2415.
 *
 * One band, three states of the same row. The phone and tablet show brand +
 * hamburger at 65px tall; the desktop grows to 76px and adds the links and the
 * orange CTA. The links are centred on the *band*, not distributed between the
 * brand and the CTA, so they stay put when either end changes width — that is
 * what Figma's absolute x on that group actually encodes.
 *
 * The inner row is measured to sit 80px outside the canvas on each side, which
 * is what Figma's 1200 row means on the 1280 frame: the brand lands 40px inside
 * the frame edge and the canvas starts 120px in. That gap is the relationship
 * worth keeping, not the 1200.
 *
 * So the row tracks the canvas rather than holding a constant. The canvas grows
 * to 1920 before the rails do (see `section-hero.tsx`), and a fixed 1200 row
 * would have flipped the relationship inside out — at 1920 the brand would sit
 * 376px *inside* a canvas edge it is supposed to sit outside. `100% - 16px`
 * against the band's own 32px padding resolves to exactly 1200 at the 1280
 * frame, and the 2080 cap is the 1920 canvas plus the same 80 either side.
 * The two caps are one number in two places: move the canvas and this follows.

        Figma draws the hamburger as a bare 24x24 hit box. The touch floor takes

        edge lands where the design puts it rather than 10px in; the extra height
        disappears into the band's 20px padding, so nothing moves.
